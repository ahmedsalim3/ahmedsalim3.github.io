This article describes the process of unsupervised learning on Telco Churn data, available on [Kaggle][data-source]. The aim is to predict customer churn, a crucial metric in the telecom industry. The dataset contains customer information, services, and demographics. Initial data visualization reveals insights about churn, gender, and partners' influence. The goal is to interpret the results like: how similar are the members in the clusters? What are the similarities within the group? Etc. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service. Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next.

Individualized customer retention is tough because most firms have a large number of customers and can't afford to devote much time to each of them. The costs would be too great, outweighing the additional revenue. However, if a corporation could forecast which customers are likely to leave ahead of time, it could focus customer retention efforts only on these "high risk" clients. The ultimate goal is to expand its coverage area and retrieve more customer’s loyalty.

Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers. To reduce customer churn, we need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

Before performing the unsupervised learning approaches, we had to know the data well in order to label the observations correctly. as well as applying data visualization techniques to observe breakpoints and helps us to internalize the data.

The dataset C-TelcoChurn consists of 7043 rows and 21. While each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes.

The data set includes information about:

1. Customers who left within the last month: the column is called Churn
2. Services that each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
3. Customer account information: how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
4. Demographic info about customers: gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

Some initial visualization of the dataset includes the proportions of churn in the dataset, counts of customers by gender who churned and counts of customers by partner who churned. They are visualized respectively in Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3. 

Figure 1 illustrates that there are more “No” churns in the dataset, Figure 2 shows that gender does not influence churn in any way and an almost identical nature is visible in Figure 3 for Partners.

## Preparation of Dataset

The process of preparing the dataset for analysis, particularly for machine learning applications, is discussed. It involves gathering, cleaning, and labeling raw data, along with data exploration and visualization. The dataset's statistics for continuous variables are presented, and the relevant columns are one-hot encoded to transform categorical data into numerical values. 

## K-Means Clustering (Partition-Based Clustering)

Figure 4 below shows the graph of the distortion score elbow for K-Means clustering. In order to find an appropriate number of clusters, the elbow method is used. In this method for this case, the inertia for a number of clusters between 2 and 10 will be calculated. The rule is to choose the number of clusters where you see a kink or “an elbow” in the graph. The graph also shows that the reduction of a distortion score as the number of clusters increases. However, there is no clear “elbow” visible. The underlying algorithm suggests 4 clusters. Hence, the choice of four or five clusters seems to be fair.

```python
X = df2.values[:,:]
model = KMeans(random_state=1)
visualizer = KElbowVisualizer(model, k=(2,10))

visualizer.fit(X)
visualizer.show()
plt.show()
```

{{< figure src="/posts/customer-churn-prediction/img4.png" alt="Figure 4: Distortion Score Elbow for K-Means Clustering" caption="Figure 4: Distortion Score Elbow for K-Means Clustering" width="100%" class="right" >}}

There is another way to choose the best number of clusters which is by plotting the silhouette score in a function of a number of clusters. Figure 5 shows the silhouette coefficient in the elbow chart.

```python
# Implementing silhouette coefficient in the elbow chart
model = KMeans(random_state=1)
visualizer = KElbowVisualizer(model, k=(2,10), metric='silhouette')

visualizer.fit(X)
visualizer.show()
plt.show()
```

{{< figure src="/posts/customer-churn-prediction/img5.png" alt="Figure 5: Silhouette Score Elbow for K-Means Clustering" caption="Figure 5: Silhouette Score Elbow for K-Means Clustering" width="100%" class="right" >}}

The algorithm is fit using the two clusters as suggested by assigning the K-means label in figure 5. A new dataframe is then created to get the relationship between the K-mean labels of the data.

```python
KM_clusters = KMeans(n_clusters=2, init='k-means++').fit(X) 
labels = KM_clusters.labels_
df2['KM_Clus'] = labels
df3 = df2.groupby('KM_Clus').mean()
```

The clusters are visualized by the scatter plot of Monthly Charges vs Tenure. Unfortunately, the clusters did not show any clear signs of relationship between each other. 

```python
#Visualizing the clusters in Tenure vs Monthly Charges
plt.scatter(df2.iloc[:, 4], df2.iloc[:, 7], 
            c=labels.astype(np.float), 
            alpha=0.5, cmap='viridis')
plt.xlabel('Tenure', fontsize=18)
plt.ylabel('Monthly Charges', fontsize=16)

plt.show()
```

{{< figure src="/posts/customer-churn-prediction/img6.png" alt="Figure 6: Scatter Plot For Clusters in Monthly Charges Vs Tenure" caption="Figure 6: Scatter Plot For Clusters in Monthly Charges Vs Tenure" width="100%" class="right" >}}

In terms of the clusters themselves, their quality can be checked by plotting silhouette of K-means clustering for 7043 samples in two centers as shown in Figure 7. A silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating that the objects well matched to its own cluster and are further apart from neighboring clusters. For cluster 0, the silhouette score is around 0.85 while the silhouette score for cluster 1 is around 0.72. Good silhouette scores demonstrated here indicates that both of them are in a good quality.

```python
from yellowbrick.cluster import SilhouetteVisualizer
model = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0)
visualizer = SilhouetteVisualizer(model, colors='yellowbrick')
visualizer.fit(X)
visualizer.show()
plt.show()
```

## DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)

It is difficult arbitrarily to say what values of epsilon and min_samples will work the best. Therefore, a matrix of investigated combinations is created first. (Matrix of Epsilon and min-samples)

```python
eps_values = np.arange(8,12.75,0.25) # eps values to be investigated
min_samples = np.arange(3,10) # min_samples values to be investigated

DBSCAN_params = list(product(eps_values, min_samples))
```
Because DBSCAN creates clusters itself based on those two parameters, the number of generated clusters based on the parameters from step 1 is collected.

```python
no_of_clusters = []
sil_score = []

for p in DBSCAN_params:
    DBS_clustering = DBSCAN(eps=p[0], min_samples=p[1]).fit(X)
    no_of_clusters.append(len(np.unique(DBS_clustering.labels_)))
    sil_score.append(silhouette_score(X, DBS_clustering.labels_))
```

A heatplot shows how many clusters were generated by the DBSCAN algorithm for the respective parameters combinations as shown in Figure 8 below.

```python
tmp = pd.DataFrame.from_records(DBSCAN_params, columns =['Eps', 'Min_samples'])   
tmp['No_of_clusters'] = no_of_clusters

pivot_1 = pd.pivot_table(tmp, values='No_of_clusters', index='Min_samples', columns='Eps')

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15,6))
sns.heatmap(pivot_1, annot=True,annot_kws={"size": 8}, cmap="YlGnBu", ax=ax)
ax.set_title('Number of clusters')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

{{< figure src="/posts/customer-churn-prediction/img8.png" alt="Figure 8: Heatmap Version 1" caption="Figure 8: Heatmap Version 1" width="100%" class="right" >}}

Heatplot from step 3 shows the number of clusters varies greatly with the minimum number of clusters of 43 and the maximum at about 520. A silhouette score is plotted as a heatmap to decide which combination of epsilon and minimum density threshold to choose. 

```python
tmp = pd.DataFrame.from_records(DBSCAN_params, columns =['Eps', 'Min_samples'])   
tmp['Sil_score'] = sil_score

pivot_1 = pd.pivot_table(tmp, values='Sil_score', index='Min_samples', columns='Eps')

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(18,6))
sns.heatmap(pivot_1, annot=True, annot_kws={"size": 10}, cmap="YlGnBu", ax=ax)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

{{< figure src="/posts/customer-churn-prediction/img9.png" alt="Figure 9: Heatmap Version 2" caption="Figure 9: Heatmap Version 2" width="100%" class="right" >}}

According to silhouette value conventions, values near +1 indicates that the samples are far away from the neighboring clusters while a value of 0 indicates that the sample is on or very close to the decision boundary between 2 neighboring clusters. Negative values on the other hand indicates that samples might have been assigned to the wrong cluster. From Figure 6, resulting silhouette values are all in negative which indicates that something is either wrong with the data or the algorithm chosen itself. The model is trained again using only continuous variables to check whether there is something wrong with the data. All binary data and one-hot encoded data are omitted. The processes for DBSCAN from step 1 to 4 are repeated.

```python
df4 = df[['tenure', 'MonthlyCharges', 'TotalCharges']]
X = df4.values[:,:]

no_of_clusters = []
sil_score = []

for p in DBSCAN_params:
    DBS_clustering = DBSCAN(eps=p[0], min_samples=p[1]).fit(X)
    no_of_clusters.append(len(np.unique(DBS_clustering.labels_)))
    sil_score.append(silhouette_score(X, DBS_clustering.labels_))

#Visualize the number of clusters for the updated criterias
tmp = pd.DataFrame.from_records(DBSCAN_params, columns =['Eps', 'Min_samples'])   
tmp['No_of_clusters'] = no_of_clusters

pivot_1 = pd.pivot_table(tmp, values='No_of_clusters', index='Min_samples', columns='Eps')

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15,6))
sns.heatmap(pivot_1, annot=True,annot_kws={"size": 8}, cmap="YlGnBu", ax=ax)
ax.set_title('Number of clusters')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

{{< figure src="/posts/customer-churn-prediction/img10.png" alt="Figure 10: Heatmap Version 3" caption="Figure 10: Heatmap Version 3" width="100%" class="right" >}}

From the Figure 10, there seems to be no major difference in the number of clusters that was derived earlier in step 3. The heatmap of silhouette scores for the updated criteria are visualized.

```python
#Visualize the heatmap of silhuette scores for the updated criteria
tmp = pd.DataFrame.from_records(DBSCAN_params, columns =['Eps', 'Min_samples'])   
tmp['Sil_score'] = sil_score

pivot_1 = pd.pivot_table(tmp, values='Sil_score', index='Min_samples', columns='Eps')

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(18,6))
sns.heatmap(pivot_1, annot=True, annot_kws={"size": 10}, cmap="YlGnBu", ax=ax)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

{{< figure src="/posts/customer-churn-prediction/img11.png" alt="Figure 11: Heatmap Version 4" caption="Figure 11: Heatmap Version 4" width="100%" class="right" >}}

As was in Figure 9, Figure 11 too produced negative values which are indicative that the dataset is not suitable for DBSCAN as no apparent number of clusters can be generated. In essence, silhouette scores rewards clustering where points are very close to their assigned centroids and far from other centroids (good cohesion and good separation). Negative scores here could be taken to mean that the algorithm could not distinguish the presence of clear and obvious clusters in the data. A scatterplot of Monthly Charges vs Tenure is visualized to show that there are no apparent clusters that can be derived.

```python
#Scatterplot of Tenure vs Monthly Charges
plt.scatter(df4['tenure'], df4['MonthlyCharges'])
plt.xlabel('Tenure', fontsize=18)
plt.ylabel('Monthly Charges', fontsize=16)
plt.show()
```

{{< figure src="/posts/customer-churn-prediction/img12.png" alt="Figure 12: Scatterplot of Monthly Charges Vs Tenure" caption="Figure 12: Scatterplot of Monthly Charges Vs Tenure" width="100%" class="right" >}}

## Performance Comparison (K-Means vs DBSCAN)
As was explored in the 2 sections above, K-Means model resulted in 2 clusters with a silhouette score of 0.703 while DBSCAN model did not result in any meaningful number of clusters and silhouette scores. This could be explained by the fact that K-Means require the number of clusters as input from the user which generally means that more than 1 cluster is possible to be derived. DBSCAN fundamentally on the hand does not need number of clusters to be specified and it locates regions of high density that are separated from one another by regions of low density. Since the majority of the data is densely populated as a whole, DBSCAN is unable to detect any apparent clusters in the dataset and is an unsuitable choice of clustering algorithm for this dataset. K-Means on the other hand proves to be a good clustering algorithm for this dataset with a silhouette score of 0.703 (close to +1). But 2 key points has to be addressed here which are:

1. Although 2 clusters are derived, no clear and apparent relationship or interesting insights could be derived from them. Plotting most of the features on a scatterplot against each other would be of minimal use as most data is either binary or numerical label which would not transmit any visual information on the presence of clusters.

2. The number of clusters are user defined, and for this case, additional number of clusters with a hit on the silhouette score is possible but there is no guarantee of generating useful insights as the data is tightly packed together as a whole.
