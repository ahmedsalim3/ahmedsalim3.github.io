Hello and welcome to my blog!

My name is Ahmed Salim, and I’m a data science researcher. I hold a [Master's degree][masters] in Data Science from [Universiti Teknologi Malaysia][utm] and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Future University][fu]. My research interests lie in natural language processing, visual reasoning, and structured computer vision problems.

I’m passionate about data science and machine learning, as well as various software engineering topics, such as data structures and algorithms. Every step of this journey feels truly magical, and I really enjoy learning and trying new cool tools.

Recently, I started freelancing on [Upwork][upwork], which has opened many doors for me to work on trending projects in my field while learning and contributing along the way. In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, reading books, and playing soccer. I'm also exploring and learning [p5.js][p5.js] and [d3.js][d3.js] on my other [website][art].

So, I created this blog as my space to share knowledge, insights, and experiences with you. I hope you could learn something from here. If you want to stay in touch, leave a comment or reach me through the social links on my [home page][home]. You can also check out my projects on [GitHub][github], and don’t forget to subscribe to this blog’s [RSS][feed] feed :wink:.
